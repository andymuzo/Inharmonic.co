				I taught myself Java and set the challenge of creating a useful, fully functional Android app. The app below is the result, It took all of my free time for months on end. Making the app work is 12,000 lines of Java, thousands of lines of XML, a multi-table SQLite database and hundreds of images. The size of the task wasn't apparent to me when I first started but I was determined to finish it. In the end it sold less than 100 copies due to the over-saturation of the Android marketplace so I have recently made it free to download and many more people are now using it. I didn't expect it to earn me a lot of money since it was a project to help me learn (and learn I did!) and I'm happy with the result. The design deliberately goes against the "flat design" ethos that many apps go for since I wanted to provide an alternative to what others were doing.

				Hwk. works around you, is fast, simple to use and extremely powerful. Keep on top of your assignments, homework, coursework, timetabled lessons, exams and session notes with little effort. Created by a lecturer and student who knows how study works. <br/>
				Now completely free, no adds, no in app purchases. Enjoy!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Features:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Homework Diary</strong><br/>
				With just a few taps you can add a new homework, task or coursework assignment into the planner. Don't hang around in class typing details into a form that forces you to fill in every detail. Just set the name and due date and you're good to go then come back to it in your own time to set the optional details.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sortable, fully functioning to-do list for each assignment</li>
				<li>Choose customised subject from a drop down menu</li>
				<li>Choose to be reminded about the assignment (see "Homework Reminder" below)</li>
				<li>Check off when it's completed and enter the grade</li>
				<li>Change any of the details at any time</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The to-do list is designed so you can break down any assignment into manageable steps. Simply enter the next steps and check them off when done; never lose track of complicated tasks again!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Homework Reminder</strong><br/>
				Ever forgotten about a task or left work at home? Hwk. will remind you with a notification if you have any homework due in the next day, whether completed or unfinished. You decide the time to be reminded and which assignments to be told about. This can be switched off in the settings if you prefer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>See Upcoming Assignments</strong><br/>
				Assignments are sorted by due date in categories of Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, Next Week, After Next Week and Completed. See what's coming up and plan your work around your due dates. Overdue assignments are highlighted in red and completed assignments in green, see at a glance what is to be done in an order that makes sense.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Grade Tracking</strong><br/>
				Pressing the sort button groups assignments by subject. Use this to keep track of your progress, see what grades you've had back and how you're doing in each subject. Really useful for module-based courses where every grade counts.

				<strong>Flexible Timetable</strong><br/>
				Turn your device landscape to see the traditional timetable layout, portrait to see the simple list view! Designed from the ground up to be extremely flexible but easy to use. Have a session on the 2nd Tuesday of every month? What about a short module running for just a few weeks in the middle of the year? Is your timetable different every other week? Want to include one-off sessions, tutorials, exams or presentation dates? All of this is as easy and as intuitive as setting up a standard weekly timetable of uniform sessions.

				I've made quite a few bits of apps, test projects, toys and games. Here are some of the more complete ones:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Beer Rater:</strong><br/>
				I made this app for a friend's wedding, they wanted to keep track of all of the quest beers they tried over the year leading up to their wedding so they could order a keg or two of their favorite for the big day. The app worked nicely and the beer went down well!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Bee Man:</strong><br/>
				A simple 2d platform game with destructible blocks and (somewhat) dynamic lighting. Made using <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a>. Sadly never finished and so not available on the Play store.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Buttons:</strong><br/>
				An interesting little puzzle game with overly-complex rules! Essentially you placed coloured buttons on the grid and used them to fend off bad buttons that would break the board as they spread. Interesting to code the game logic and to create all of the graphical assets for but again one that never saw the light of day due to confused play-testers.
