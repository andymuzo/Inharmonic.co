		<h3>Achievements</h3>
		<div class="page_item_body">
			<p>
				I am a firm advocate of using technology where appropriate in the classroom to solve specific problems. A few years ago I came second place in a contest for use of technology in the classroom (see newspaper clipping!). I have since been to a number of conventions on the topic and have put a few things into action. The main ones are my <a href="android.html">homework diary app</a>, <a href="http://rhosmusic.wikia.com/wiki/RhosMusic_Wiki">classroom wiki</a>, <a href="muso.html">music theory flash game</a> and the creative coding club I've started this year with my music technology students.

		<h2>Philosophy of Teaching</h2>

			<p>
				I have been a classroom teacher/lecturer/tutor for the past 8 years. I'm fortunate in that I've had lots of opportunities to lead courses and mentor a trainee teacher in that time. As a result my current role is Program Leader for Music Technology Level 3 and Curriculum Coordinator for Expressive Arts. In this section I'll talk through some of my thoughts on teaching and running courses, trying to explain the core philosophy that guides my professional practice in blog-like entries that I'll be adding to as time goes on.

		<h3>Course Planning</h3>
		<div class="page_item_body">
			<p>
				I'm a firm believer that courses should be planned primarily from the student's point of view. Planning a course is a process of looking at the reasons why a student is studying the subject, what they hope to get out of it, their understanding of what the subject is about and then bending the qualification as close to that as possible. It is also important to look at when in the year a student struggles the most.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>An example from a few years ago:</strong><br/>
				When I took over as Coordinator for a level 2 Music Technology course the successful completion (amount of students enrolled at the start vs. amount of students leaving having passed the qualification) was at around 50%. Attendance was pretty bad at certain times of the year as well, in particular the slump after the Christmas holidays where we would typically get most of our drop-outs and bad attendance patters. The course was 1 year long and full time, all the students had chosen to be there. I also found the student's attitude towards the modules to be inconsistent, obviously we all prefer some topics more than others but there was a tendency to only try to do work for the modules that immediately interested them. In short there was no feeling of course ownership by the students.
			</p>
			<p>
				In redesigning the course the challenge as I saw it was to turn a collection of modules into a consistent, meaningful journey for the students. I wanted to address the problem of the post-Christmas slump by having a large vocational project that would be exciting and relavent. After researching some additional small courses I found the Work Skills qualification, it fit in nicely with what I was trying to do and I got permission to include in with the main qualification. The project I chose was running a record label. Everyone would have a job role and they would hold weekly meetings to decide what they had to do next. This led to changing the whole structure of the course so that the 1st term was sold as skill building. The students did modules on recording, the music industry, mixing etc. All the while knowing that in the new year they would be running the record label as a class. The running of the label went well and attendance shot up, partly because it was an interesting thing to do but also because the student's were in charge of the label - they felt that they were an important part of the core aspect of the course.
			</p>
			<p>
				The end result from a statistics point of view? 85% successful completion, 2 years in a row - above line with the national average. We also found that more students were progressing onto the level 3 course the following year, and of those students more of them were completing the level 3 course and progressing to university. 85% might not sound too impressive but when the class size is taken into account that means only 2 students left during the course of the year, both for personal reasons unrelated to the course. In an attempt to improve further we are working more closely with the student councillors at our college, the problem only being exposed having made the course work properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously this isn't the whole story, there are many small changes in how the course works after making the large-scale changes to structure that enable the course to function well. Also worth noting that I'm not advocating that all courses should involve students running a business. That worked for this course because it addressed the specific problems it was facing. I have since then taken charge of the level 3 course, the statistics were alright but could be better. I redesigned the 2 year course to structure it into 5 different 'aspects' (composition, music studies, technical, performance and enterprise) and treated each one as a balanced route of progression, again turning a collection of modules into a course or journey. At he time of writing the course is on track for 94% successful completion.
